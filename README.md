# 🦦 Mission Otter — Interactive Portfolio

An interactive, space-themed "docking simulator" that doubles as my personal portfolio.  
Built to showcase my coding style, physics intuition, and enthusiasm for **simulation + autonomy systems**.

## 🎯 Motivation

This project was designed as a playful, technical way to introduce myself to teams like **Starfish Space**.  
Instead of a static resume, you get to *dock the otter* to unlock my background, projects, and contact info.

- **React + Vite** — fast, modern frontend framework
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling for rapid iteration
- **Framer Motion** — smooth animations & transitions
